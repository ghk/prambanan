tuple:
    are Array

list:
    are Array,
    and by default Array.prototype are monkey patched with, pop, append, etc

dict:
    are Object,
    and Object protoype is not monkey patched so there are no:
        items, (use enumerate(dict) instead)
        keys, (use iter(dict) instead)
        etc
loop:
    for translated to for i, so even xrange are not lazy

function call:
    every named arguments became keyword arguments i.e
    fn(52, action="go") ->
        fn(52, Prambanan.helpers.make_kwargs({"action": "go"})

callable:
    not supported

__add__, __sub__ not supported:
    use manually e.g. new datetime().__add__(new timedelta())

#Not supported and will error:

tuple variable in class declaration
multiple assignment in class declaration
while else
list comprehension with more than one generator
decorators that only supported, @staticmethod, @JS_NoOp
python 3 super
literals in dictionary key which are not string or number
comparison with more than one operator -> 10 > a > 13
yield
